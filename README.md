# FractalTree_CGAVR
This recursive OpenGL code generates a Fractal Tree, starting from the screen's bottom center and branching out at fixed angles. With each recursive call, smaller branches are drawn at ±25° angles, creating a tree-like structure that animates progressively by increasing depth over time.
